    ## Introduction
    This project aims to develop a deep learning model for automated diagnosis of 14 common thoracic diseases using chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray 14 dataset. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and extensive data augmentation, the model seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce human error, and support medical professionals, especially in resource-limited settings. By rigorously training and fine-tuning the model, the project aspires to create a reliable tool for real-world clinical applications to improve healthcare quality.
